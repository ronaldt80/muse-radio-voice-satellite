[![YouTube Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/rKYeiVDZrrU/0.jpg)](https://youtube.com/shorts/rKYeiVDZrrU)


This is an ESPHome configuration that turns the [Raspiaudio Muse Radio](https://raspiaudio.com/product/muse-radio/) into a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) voice satellite.

This project builds upon the work of [Tetele](https://github.com/tetele/muse-radio-voice-satellite) thanks🙏 for you help ! . I have added several screen interfaces and fixed (hopefully) the keyword detection.
